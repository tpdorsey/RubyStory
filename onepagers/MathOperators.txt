# Math Operators

A quick reminder of some of the math **operators** you can use in Ruby (and most other programming languages).

Here are the basic math symbols:

Operator | Description
--- | ---
\+ | Addition
\- | Subtraction
\* | Multiplication
\ | Division 
% | Modulo (returns the remainder of division)

These work exactly as you'd expect, except division.

Dividing **integers** (whole numbers) returns only a whole integer quotient:

    7 / 3 = 2

Of at least one of the numbers has a decimal point (a floating-point value, or **float**), you'll get a decimal result:

    7.0 / 3 = 2.3333333333333335

The **modulo** operator gives you just the remainder of the integer division operation:

    7 / 3 = 2
    7 % 3 = 1

More than you probably wanted to know.
