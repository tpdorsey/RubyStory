# If Statements

Simple if statement:

    if statement
        command to do
    end

An if...elsif...else statement:

    if statement 1
        command to do if statement 1 is true
    elsif statement 2
        command to do if statement 2 is true
    else
        command to do if all statements are false
    end

A function statement:

    def function name
        command to do
    end

A function that takes a variable as input:

    def function name(variable)
        command to do
    end

That's pretty much all we covered. You can write a lot of code with just this.
