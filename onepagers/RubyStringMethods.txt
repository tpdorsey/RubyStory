# Ruby String Methods

This is kind of an advanced concept, but you might find it useful to play with.

We've talked about basic **types** of things so far: numbers (**integers**) and words (**strings**).

Some programming languages have things called **objects**. Objects can contain numbers or words, but also have **properties** and **methods**.

Properties contain information about the object: what's in it, how big it is.

Methods are **functions** (actions) the object can do.

In Ruby, everything is an object. Strings contain words, but also know how long the word is (a property), and do things to the word (using methods).

You can **call** (use) a method by typing the variable name for the string, a period and the method you want to use. (This is called **dot syntax** by the big kids.) 

    string_variable.method

Other than that it's just like referencing a variable as we've done previously.

    mystring = "Vorpal Sword"
    
    puts "My string is %s." % mystring
    puts "My string is %d characters long." % mystring.length
    puts "quietly: %s" % mystring.downcase
    puts "YELLING: %s" % mystring.upcase

Note that the string referenced by the variable name is not changed.

    puts "%s is still the same." % mystring

Here are a few of the interesting methods you can call on a string:

* capitalize
* chomp
* downcase
* length
* reverse
* swapcase
* upcase

There are many more.
