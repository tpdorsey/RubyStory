# Ruby Commands

Here's a quick reminder of the Ruby commands and patterns we covered.

Command | Description
--- | ---
puts | Print a message to the terminal
print | Print a message, without a line return
gets.chomp | Capture input as a string
Integer(gets.chomp) | Capture input as a number
\# | Comment the rest of the line
\#{variable} | Inline variable substitution in a string
%s | Placeholder for a string variable in a string
%d | Placeholder for a number variable in a string

Assign a variable:

    variable_name = variable_value

Substituting a variable in a string:

    puts "My name is #{name}."
    puts "This is a string: %s." % name
    puts "This is a number: %d." % number

Capturing input to a variable:

    name = gets.chomp
    number = Integer(gets.chomp)

Simple if statement:

    if statement
        command to do
    end

An if...elsif...else statement:

    if statement 1
        command to do if statement 1 is true
    elsif statement 2
        command to do if statement 2 is true
    else
        command to do if all statements are false
    end

A function statement:

    def function name
        command to do
    end

A function that takes a variable as input:

    def function name(variable)
        command to do
    end

That's pretty much all we covered. You can write a lot of code with just this.
